# Twitter-Sentiment-analysis-ML

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets by applying machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify tweets into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**. The dataset consists of approximately 1 million tweets, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive representation of public sentiment across various topics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing tweets, removing irrelevant elements such as special characters, URLs, and stop words.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of two models:
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  

## Results
- Naive Bayes Classifier achieved an accuracy of 74.08%.
- SVM outperformed Naive Bayes with an accuracy of 85.35%.

## Conclusion
The SVM classifier provided better performance in sentiment classification due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data. Future improvements could include deep learning models such as RNNs or transformers like BERT to capture complex patterns in text.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced deep learning techniques like **RNNs** or **BERT**.
- Include additional features such as **user metadata** and **engagement metrics**.
- Address **dataset imbalance** using oversampling or class weighting techniques.
- Explore **real-time sentiment analysis** using data streaming technologies.
